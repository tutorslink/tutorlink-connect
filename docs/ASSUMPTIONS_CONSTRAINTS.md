# Assumptions & Constraints — Tutors Link

Documents the assumptions, constraints, and known open items that shaped
implementation decisions. Corresponds to SRS §27.

---

## Assumptions

### A-1 — Single Appwrite database per environment
The value of `VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` (surfaced via
`src/integrations/appwrite/client.ts` as `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`) is the
sole database in each environment.  All new collections introduced during
the analytics sprint (`users`, `tutor_profiles`) are in this same database
and are already provisioned by `scripts/appwrite-setup.ts`.

### A-2 — `$createdAt` populated by Appwrite
All Appwrite documents carry a system-level `$createdAt` ISO 8601 timestamp.
The enrollment-trend chart (`src/lib/analytics.ts` `getEnrollmentTrend`)
depends on this field being present and accurate. If a document was
backfilled/imported without going through Appwrite's document creation API,
`$createdAt` will be absent and that record will be silently excluded from
trend data (safe degradation per A-7).

### A-3 — `DataStore` is the authoritative client for domain reads
All product features read platform data through `src/lib/data-store.ts`.
The analytics module (`src/lib/analytics.ts`) is intentionally additive:
it reuses `DataStore` public methods for all data it can reach that way,
and falls back to direct Appwrite reads *only* for fields `DataStore` does
not expose (specifically `$createdAt` timestamps needed for trend charts).
This keeps the analytics layer thin and avoids duplicating business logic.

### A-4 — Role identifiers are stable strings
Role-based access guards compare against the string literals
`"website_manager"`, `"owner"`, and `"recruitment"`.  These must match
whatever values `DataStore.getUserRoles` returns.  Any rename in the roles
collection or in `appwrite-setup.ts` must be reflected in all three guarded
pages (`admin/index.tsx`, `admin/analytics.tsx`, `recruitment/index.tsx`).

### A-5 — Lessons have a `starts_at` ISO datetime field
`getLessonTrend` and `getAdminDashboardMetrics` bucket lessons by
`starts_at`.  If the field name differs in production, update the
`(l as any).starts_at` references in `analytics.ts` accordingly.

### A-6 — Lessons carry a `subject` string field
`getTopSubjects` groups lessons by the `subject` field.  Lessons with a
missing or empty subject are silently excluded from the subjects chart.

### A-7 — All analytics failures degrade gracefully
Every Appwrite call in `src/lib/analytics.ts` is wrapped in a `safeList`
helper that returns `[]` on error, matching the resilience pattern in
`data-store.ts`.  Dashboards will render with zeroed metrics rather than
crashing if a collection is temporarily unavailable or if the app is running
against local mock data.

### A-8 — CSV export is browser-side only
`downloadCsv` (§20.13) creates a Blob URL and triggers a click on an
`<a>` element.  It therefore requires a real browser environment and will
not work in SSR/server contexts.  The export button is rendered only inside
client components, so this is safe.

## Constraints

### C-1 — No new dependencies added in the analytics sprint
`src/lib/analytics.ts` uses only packages already present in `package.json`:
Appwrite SDK (`appwrite`), Recharts (`recharts`), and the existing Lucide
icon set.  No new `npm install` step is required.

### C-2 — Analytics aggregation is computed on the client, in memory
At current data volumes this is acceptable.  The aggregation reads at most
a few thousand documents per page load.  At materially larger scale (tens of
thousands of lessons or users), the analytics functions should move to a
server function or precomputed/cached representation (see §20.15 and
`docs/MAINTENANCE.md` §5).

### C-3 — Role-based access is enforced client-side per page
Auth guards on `admin/index.tsx`, `admin/analytics.tsx`, and
`recruitment/index.tsx` call `DataStore.getUserRoles` after the component
mounts and show `<EmptyState>` for unauthorized users.  This is intentional
client-side defense-in-depth for the UI layer; the actual data is protected
by Appwrite/Supabase RLS policies and is not exposed via unguarded API
routes.  A follow-up task to move these guards centrally into
`_authenticated.tsx`'s `beforeLoad` is tracked in C-4.

### C-4 — Centralized auth enforcement is a known open item
**Open item (tracked):** Role-based guards are currently per-page rather
than centralized in the `_authenticated` layout's `beforeLoad` hook.
A centralized implementation would be more maintainable and eliminate the
risk of a new page being added without its own guard.  This is flagged for
a follow-up sprint and does not block the current analytics release, because
data is already protected at the Appwrite/Supabase layer (C-3).

### C-5 — AI Assistant analytics not implemented (§20.8)
Conversations in the current chatbot implementation (`/api/chatbot.ts`,
`AIChatbot.tsx`) are not persisted to any database — each request is
stateless.  §20.8 (AI Assistant usage analytics) therefore cannot be
implemented without first adding conversation persistence, which is out of
scope for this sprint.  The `aiAssistantEnabled` flag in
`AdminDashboardMetrics` reflects only whether the AI config record sets
`enabled: true`, not session volume.

### C-6 — Website analytics not implemented (§20.9)
§20.9 (Website Analytics) requires an external analytics platform
(e.g. Plausible, PostHog, or Google Analytics).  No such integration exists
yet.  This is explicitly listed as a future enhancement in the SRS itself.

### C-7 — Dual backend (Appwrite + Supabase)
The project currently ships both `src/integrations/appwrite` and
`src/integrations/supabase`.  New features should confirm which backend the
relevant collection lives in before adding queries.  The analytics module
targets Appwrite exclusively (matching `data-store.ts`).
